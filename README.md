# splashback_tools
Collection of code for computing splashback related quantities for halo profiles.


The package requires `pymultinest, joblib`, and `tqdm` for fitting and parallelization. Once these are installed and the repository has been cloned, the package can be installed by going into the directory with the `setup.py` file and executing `pip install .`

`pymultinest`, `tqdm`, and `joblib` are all pip installable, but `pymultinest` requires `multinest` to be installed. Details are here: https://johannesbuchner.github.io/PyMultiNest/install.html
